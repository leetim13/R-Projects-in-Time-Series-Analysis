This report is part of October 2019's [Statistics Canada: Business Data Scientist Challenge](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/cder/announcements). The goal of this challenge is to create timely estimates of current GDP based on other, more readily available information; (also referred to as `nowcasting`). For simplicity, I have chosen to only work on the Sector/Industry Group of `Retail Trade`, where the data is obtained [StatCan Table: 36-10-0208-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3610020801) called “Multifactor productivity, value-added, capital input and labour input in the aggregate business sector and major sub-sectors, by industry”. The data is also selected with selected with the `North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)` filter and contains annual data from 1961-2018 for a range of economic variables, such as `Labour Productivity`, `Capital Productivity`, `Multifactor Productivity`, etc.
Both `VAR(p)` model and `ARMA-error regression model` with various external regressors have been fitted and analyzed.
