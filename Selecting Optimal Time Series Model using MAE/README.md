The data loaded is a bivariate time series object consisting of two Canadian monthly macroeconomic series.   

Variable `emp` contains the raw (unadjusted) number of employed individuals (in 1,000’s).  
Variable `gdp` contains the *seasonally adjusted* real GDP, chained to 2012 $’s (in 1,000,000’s).

The goal of this mini project is to determine the best time series model to forecast GDP values using the MAE of the forecasts versus the actual GDP values from the latest year.
